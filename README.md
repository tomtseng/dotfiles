# Tom's Dotfiles

Here are some of my dotfile configurations. This is for personal use so that I
can get set up quickly on a new machine.

## Installation

Running `bash install.sh` should perform a lot of the setup, though it's not a
well-tested script. It's meant for Mac OS X or for Ubuntu.

Some gotchas:
- Mac:
  - In `.zshrc`, the `ls` alias will need to be changed.
- Ubuntu:
  - I haven't added i3 installation to the script yet.
